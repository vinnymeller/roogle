# roogle

roogle is a cli tool for fuzzy finding function signatures in Rust source code.

A couple weeks ago I started learning Haskell, and thought [Hoogle](https://hoogle.haskell.org/) was great. 

After actually learning about Hoogle, I remembered an article I read a while back about ASTs and Rust. After spending some time to find it again, I prevailed! "There's no reason something like Hoogle couldn't exist for Rust." - [Things you could do with the Rust AST](https://kamalmarhubi.com/blog/2016/06/02/playing-with-the-rust-ast/) by Kamal Marhubi. 

I thought that would be an interesting idea and didn't do anything about it.

Then, suddenly [Tsoding](https://github.com/tsoding) <sup>([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/TsodingDaily), [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/tsoding))</sup> drops [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wK1HjnwDQng) about his cli tool, coogle - the same for C.

The only answer now was that I had to try it, even if just for fun. The worst case, I write some useless Rust code. Best case, I have roogle!

So here it is. WIP
